# Cyril
A finance management desktop app created in JavaScript with Node, Electron, and React.
Tells you about, and hopefully doesn't lie about, your recent spending habits so that you can go about your day entirely self conscious about every dollar you spend.

## To Run
`yarn install` (once)  
`yarn start`  
That's it.

---

## Structure
This project uses electron-forge for scaffolding and Vite to handle the dev process.

## To Do
* Look into Recharts as a library for charts
