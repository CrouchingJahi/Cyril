      <p>A finance management app for desktop. Tells you about, and hopefully doesn't lie about, your recent spending habits so that you can go about your day entirely self conscious about every dollar you spend.</p>
      <h2>To Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Change the build script to build the binaries. Add relevant electron build config to package.json</li>
        <li>Look into Recharts as a chart library.</li>
